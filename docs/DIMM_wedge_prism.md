# Sourcing a Wedge Prism for a DIMM 

## Requirements for Wedge Prisms

These are the requirements for a Wedge prism to use in front of a 8 inch aperature:

| Parameter                    | Dimension          |
|-----------------------------:|:------------------:|
| Free aperture                | ~50 mm             |
| deflection of incident light | ~1 arcmin          |
| Anti-reflective coating      | both sides, visual |
| Material                     | N-BK7 or similar   |
| Edges                        | chamfer applied    |

## Risley Prisms
A [Risley Prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_prism#Beam_steering) combines two wedge prisms. By using an angle between the wedge prisms, one can freely choose the deflection from \(0 \textrm{-} 2x\) the deflection angle of a single prism. 
Note that in the case of 0°, the beam is shifted (but parallel to the incident beam).  

Here are calculation formulas for [Risley Prisms](https://wp.optics.arizona.edu/optomech/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2016/10/for-Mark.pdf).

This means instead of sourcing custom-made wedge prisms, one can order two "standard" prisms with a low deflection and combine these to give the needed deflection.
Standard deflection that are available are 0.5° and up, in circular or square shapes from 10 mm - 100 mm for acceptable prices. Check the [usual sources](
https://www.rp-photonics.com/wedge_prisms.html). Note that sometimes you have to look for "laser windows" to get the larger diameters. 

## Attention: Flat window needed!

Note that to get both star images into focus, you should correct for the additional glass infront of your telescope aperture. 
So order a \(2x\) thickness glass plate (both sides AR-coated) in addition.
